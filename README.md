```

# Malware Investigations

#### Compilation Process

- Source Code: Human readable e\.g\. C code 

- Object Files: Binary code with readable symbols

- Executable: Binary code without readable symbols

- Decompiling: usually very difficult so dissasembly is used instead

- Dissasembly: transforms the binary executable into readable assembly code
